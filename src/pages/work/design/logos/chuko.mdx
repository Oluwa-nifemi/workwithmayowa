## Chuko's Food and Spices is a brand that makes fast, affordable and tasty food. They also make spices for different sauces and soups.

With Chuko's Food and Spices, it's more than just "eating", it’s delivering joy and happiness with every bite.

I worked on designing a logo that captured the playful and happy nature of the brand especially as their mission statement is “Smile on your face, joy in your tummy”

<Carousel marginBottom={50}>
  {
    props.data.carousel.nodes.map(image => (
      <ArticleCarouselItem
        fluid={image.childImageSharp.fluid}
    />
    ))
  }
</Carousel>

export const pageQuery = graphql`
 {
  carousel: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq:"digital/chuko/carousel"}}, sort: {fields: name, order: ASC}){
      nodes{
        name
        childImageSharp{
          fluid(quality: 100){
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp
          }
        }
      }
    }
 }
