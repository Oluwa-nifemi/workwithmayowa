## Tinkerman Expressions is a creative director. He takes ideas and brings them to life using beautiful storytelling techniques.

The objective was to create a logo that aptly represents his brand.

### ![Melange](../../../../assets/images/digital/tinkerman/tinkerman.png)

The minimalistic style was selected to keep the design timeless. The combination of the simple wordmark and swirl captures the feel of “Melange” being high class yet relaxed and fun.

<Carousel>
  {
    props.data.carousel.nodes.map(image => (
      <ArticleCarouselItem
        fluid={image.childImageSharp.fluid}
        maxWidth='50vw'
      />
    ))
  }
</Carousel>

export const pageQuery = graphql`
 {
  carousel: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq:"digital/tinkerman/carousel"}}, sort: {fields: name, order: ASC}){
      nodes{
        name
        childImageSharp{
          fluid(quality: 100){
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp
          }
        }
      }
