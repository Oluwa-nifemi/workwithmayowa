## Tinkerman Expressions is a creative director. He takes ideas and brings them to life using beautiful storytelling techniques.

The objective was to create a logo that aptly represents his brand.

The simple design cleverly mimics a body and the orange colour was selected because it represents fun and creativity.

<Carousel marginBottom={50}>
  {
    props.data.carousel.nodes.map(image => (
      <ArticleCarouselItem
        fluid={image.childImageSharp.fluid}
      />
    ))
  }
</Carousel>

export const pageQuery = graphql`
 {
  carousel: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq:"digital/tinkerman/carousel"}}, sort: {fields: name, order: ASC}){
      nodes{
        name
        childImageSharp{
          fluid(quality: 100){
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp
          }
        }
      }
    }
 }
