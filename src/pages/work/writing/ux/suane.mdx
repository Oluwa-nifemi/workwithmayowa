## Suane Digitals is a creative agency that works with new businesses to increase sales through brand positioning and design. Their website was in need of a copy overhaul as it didn’t properly represent them and what they did.

Their brand voice is bold and confident, they believe in helping young brands build a strong identity so I ensured this tone and voice was reflected in the website copy.

# Homepage

The former copy on the homepage wasn’t clear so I rewrote it to be more direct yet interesting enough for whoever was seeing it.

<Carousel>
  {
    props.data.landingImages.nodes.map(node => (
      <ArticleCarouselItem
        name={node.name}
        fluid={node.childImageSharp.fluid}
        maxWidth='750px'
      />
    ))
  }
</Carousel>

# Services

The “Services” section also didn't have accurate descriptions so I edited each service description.

<Carousel>
  {
    props.data.servicesImages.nodes.map(node => (
      <ArticleCarouselItem
        name={node.name}
        fluid={node.childImageSharp.fluid}
        maxWidth='750px'
      />
    ))
  }
</Carousel>

# About

The “About” section was rewritten to clearly show what Suane Digitals represented.

<Carousel>
  {
    props.data.aboutImages.nodes.map(node => (
      <ArticleCarouselItem
        name={node.name}
        fluid={node.childImageSharp.fluid}
        maxWidth='750px'
      />
    ))
  }
</Carousel>

export const pageQuery = graphql`
 {
  aboutImages: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq:"articles/suane/about"}}, sort: {fields: name, order: DESC}){
      nodes{
        name
        childImageSharp{
          fluid(quality: 80){
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp
          }
        }
      }
    }
  landingImages: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq:"articles/suane/landing"}}, sort: {fields: name, order: DESC}){
      nodes{
        name
        childImageSharp{
        fluid(quality: 80){
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp
          }
        }
      }
    }
  servicesImages: allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq:"articles/suane/services"}}, sort: {fields: name, order: DESC}){
    nodes{
      name
      childImageSharp{
      fluid(quality: 80){
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp
        }
      }
    }
  }
 }
